## Solution
- Read files in line by line
- split line into 2 parts, numbers and text
- store in map, numbers as key, string as value
- Pyramid pattern means only triangular numbers are used
- find triangular numbers and search for the associated value in the map
- add value to result string
- stop when triangular numbers reach map size
